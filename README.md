## Problem Solved

Farmers often face challenges in predicting crop prices and selecting the right crops to grow. Without proper market analysis, they can end up with less profitable crops or get poor returns on their harvest. Additionally, many farmers struggle with understanding what crops to sow, when to sow, and what would be the best output for their land.

**Fasal solves these problems by:**
- Predicting crop prices using a machine learning model that analyzes market trends.
- Suggesting the best crops based on soil type, water availability, and other factors using a neural network model.
- Helping farmers make data-driven decisions for better yield and profit.
